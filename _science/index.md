### Bioinformatic tool development

The ability to generate data that describes the microbial world continues to grow rapidly. This requires that we develop and assess computational tools that allow us to synthesize these data to tell robust and compelling stories that solve important problems. We have been at the fore front of efforts to develop tools that are widely used by microbial ecologists for the past 15 years. Our tools have facilitated the analysis of 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic sequence data, metabolomics data, and clinical data.
