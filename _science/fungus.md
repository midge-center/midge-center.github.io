A high skin fungal burden is a defining feature of *Candida auris*, and this burden is associated with increased risk of disease. The first step in this process is the ability of strains to attach and adhere, on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. This attachment also is the first step in the formation of biofilms, which are linked with both persistence and antifungal drug resistance. However, the cell biology and genetic circuitry underlying the ability of *C. auris* to colonize the skin are not known. Our goal is to identify the genetic determinants and regulation of *C. auris* skin colonization and thus persistence and transmission between individuals. We have developed genetic tools for interrogating this organism, giving us unprecedented power to analyze the genes required for *C. auris* colonization. We will use a population genetics and genome-wide association approach to identify naturally-occurring variants that are associated with increased attachment. We complement these studies by performing forward genetics screens to uncover new effectors and regulators of *C. auris* skin attachment and by experimental evolution to identify variants of concern for skin colonization. Together, these studies will advance new concepts for how *C. auris* can regulate adherence, colonization, and outbreak potential.
