Each project in the MIDGE Center generates large genomic compendia, which are analyzed in the context of rich phenotypic measurements. The Technology and Data Core supports these projects and the overall mission of MIDGE by providing intellectual capacity, technical skill, and infrastructure to enable genomic and phenotypic data generation, analysis and dissemination of data, resources, and results to the research community. Specific activities of the core include: facilitating genomic data generation, quality control and rapid dissemination of cleaned sequence data, providing capacity for extraction of genetic variation from cleaned sequencing data, providing support for laboratory automation, high-throughput phenotyping and integration of phenotypic and genotypic data through advanced phylogenetic analysis and mGWAS, and ensuring consistent and uniform sharing of data, protocols and software emanating from MIDGE.
