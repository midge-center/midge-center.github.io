We develop computational workflows and tools to help us analyze multi-omics data and make sense of amplicon and genomic data. Click on the badges below to learn more about each of the workflows and tools.


### HMPV IRMA module

A module for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) to be used with [IRMA](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/irma/index.html). The consensus sequences are derived from all whole genomes available on GenBank on October 18, 2024.

### RSV amplicon sequencing

A protocol for RSV-A and RSV-B sequencing that consists of two pools of overlapping amplicons. It is designed to work with current Arctic SARS-CoV-2 protocols.
