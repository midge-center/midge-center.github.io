			Our research lab has many ways of outputting our discoveries. One of our primary approaches and the one our peers judge us by are our publications. Here are all of the papers generated by the lab along with PDF copies of the papers. Of course, a paper is just a way station along the scientific method. With this in mind, in 2014 we started to generate papers as reproducible documents that contain the code used to go from raw data to the final version of the manuscript that we submitted to the journal for review. We'd love it if you were able to take our data or code and build upon it to help your scientific story. Feel free to holler if you have questions about this process or about how we analyzed the data in our other publications.
