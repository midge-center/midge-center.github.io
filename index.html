	<h1>The Michigan Infectious Disease Genomics (MIDGE) Center</h2>
	<div class="quote">
		The organizing principle for the Michigan Infectious Disease Genomics Center is that the natural diversity of pathogens can be exploited to identify genetic determinants of key phenotypes. Here, epidemics are “evolutionary experiments in nature” and we will develop and apply innovative genomic approaches to determine how these natural experiments have influenced transmission, drug resistance, colonization, and virulence.

				<h3>Our Mission</h3>
				<p style="font-size: 14pt">The advent of genomic sequencing technologies has revolutionized our understanding of disease transmission, pathogen evolution, drug resistance, and virulence. Pathogens can quickly adapt to new environments and treatments, making it critical to understand the underlying genetic changes that drive this process. The Michigan Infectious Disease Genomics (MIDGE) Center features three projects - viruses, bacteria, and fungi - unified by a common theme of identifying pathogen determinants of epidemic success and by a common approach that combines genomic surveillance, functional genomics, and high-throughput phenotyping assays</p>
